    <p>Street-side plantings refer to trees, shrubs, and other vegetation planted along roads to provide environmental benefits like controlling dust and erosion,
         offering shade, and sequestering carbon, as well as aesthetic and community advantages such as beautification and creating a productive asset.
          When planning these plantings, it's important to consider factors like ownership of the road reserve,
         potential future road widening, the economic and functional value of specific plant species, and safety requirements for road vision and access. </p>
