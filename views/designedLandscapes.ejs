    <p>A designed landscape is an area of land which has been modified by people for primarily aesthetic effect.
         The term is used by historians to denote various types of site, such as gardens, parks, cemeteries, and estates.
          Such sites are often protected for their historic or artistic value. A designed landscape may comprise landform,
         water, built structures, trees and plants, all of which may be naturally occurring or introduced.</p>
